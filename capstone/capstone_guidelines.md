# 🎓 Capstone Project Guidelines

## Overview
The capstone project is your opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the entire data science lifecycle by building an end-to-end bike availability prediction system.

---

## 🛤️ Choose Your Track

**You must select one of two capstone tracks based on your learning path:**

### Track A: Real-Time Commuter Availability (Classification)
**Project Goal:** Build a binary classification system that predicts whether bikes will be available at a station in the next 15 minutes.
- **Audience:** Daily commuters who need immediate answers
- **Prediction Type:** Binary (Available/Not Available) + confidence
- **Time Horizon:** 15 minutes ahead
- **Use Case:** "Should I walk to this station or choose another?"
- **Recommended if you completed:** Module 4 Track A & Module 5 Track A

### Track B: Multi-Day Tourist Forecasting (Regression)
**Project Goal:** Build a time series forecasting system that predicts bike availability 24-72 hours ahead.
- **Audience:** Tourists planning their visit
- **Prediction Type:** Continuous (number of available bikes) + uncertainty intervals
- **Time Horizon:** 24-72 hours ahead
- **Use Case:** "How many bikes will be available Tuesday morning?"
- **Recommended if you completed:** Module 4 Track B & Module 5 Track B

**Note:** You may also attempt **both tracks** if you completed all sub-track modules and want an advanced challenge.

- [ ] Evaluate multi-horizon forecasts (24h, 48h, 72h)
- [ ] Perform hyperparameter tuning (lag orders, seasonality)
- [ ] Document performance: **RMSE, MAE, MAPE by horizon**
- [ ] Quantify prediction uncertainty (confidence intervals)

### 5. Validation & Governance (10%)
**Track A (Classification):**
- [ ] Validate on held-out test data
- [ ] Analyze confusion matrix (focus on false negatives)
- [ ] Perform error analysis by time of day, station type
