# Module 07: Visualization & Communication

## 📌 Module Overview
Create compelling visualizations and dashboards to communicate insights to stakeholders.

---

## 🎯 Track-Aware Visualization

**Visualization needs differ significantly between classification and regression/forecasting models.**

### Visualization Differences by Track

| Aspect | Track A (Classification) | Track B (Regression/Time Series) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Primary Viz** | Confusion matrix heatmaps, ROC curves | Time series plots, forecast bands |
| **Performance Display** | Precision/Recall bars, F1 scores | RMSE trends, residual plots |
| **Predictions** | Binary indicators (available/not) | Numeric values with uncertainty |
| **Dashboard Focus** | Real-time availability alerts | Multi-day forecast calendars |
| **Key Insights** | False positive/negative patterns | Seasonal trends, forecast accuracy |
| **User Interface** | Traffic light indicators, alerts | Line charts with confidence intervals |

### Common Visualization Tasks (Both Tracks)
- Feature importance charts
- Model comparison plots
- Station-level performance maps
- Time-of-day patterns
- Weather impact visualizations
- Stakeholder reports

## 🎓 Course Development Strategy

### Pedagogical Approach for This Module
Module 7 teaches **visualization and communication** - essential data science skills.

**Scaffolding Strategy:**
- **Initial**: 65% complete - Learn visualization best practices
- **Progressive**: 65% → 20% for creative freedom
- **Goal**: Design effective visualizations independently, communicate insights clearly
- **Approach**: Design principles → Tools → Practice → Create custom dashboards

**Progressive Difficulty (Each Notebook):**
- Part 1: Visualization Principles (80% complete)
- Part 2: Basic Charts (55%)
- Part 3: Interactive Viz (40%)
- Part 4: Dashboard Design (25%)
- Part 5: Custom Dashboards (15% + creative projects)

**Solution Notebooks:**
- Separate `*_SOLUTIONS.ipynb` with design alternatives
- Multiple visualization approaches
- Best practices and accessibility considerations

**Optional Challenges:**
- Real-time dashboards
- Mobile-responsive designs
- Storytelling with data

- Check [code snippets](../../docs/standards/code_snippets.md) for visualization examples
- Reference [reporting template](../../docs/standards/reporting_template.md) for stakeholder communication
- Keep dashboards simple and focused
- Design for your audience (technical vs business)
- Test with real users if possible
- Follow [coding standards](../../docs/standards/coding_standards.md) for clean code
