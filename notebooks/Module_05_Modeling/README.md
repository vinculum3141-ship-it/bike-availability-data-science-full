## ⚠️ Critical Domain Insight for Course Developers

**OV-fiets System Characteristics:**
- **No docking system**: `docks_available` field is always 0
- **Same-station returns**: Bikes must return to origin station
- **After-hours flexibility**: Bikes can be left outside without docking

**Impact on Module 5 Modeling:**
- ❌ **INVALID target variables**:
  - Cannot predict "dock availability"
  - Cannot model dock-to-bike ratios
  - Cannot predict rebalancing needs between stations

- ✅ **VALID target variables**:
  - `bikes_available` at specific stations (primary target)
  - `bikes_available` at future time points (time-series)
  - `station_empty_probability` (binary classification)

- ✅ **Key modeling constraints**:
  - Predictions must respect: `0 ≤ bikes_available ≤ station_capacity`
  - Consider same-station return flow (bikes don't transfer between stations)
  - Model station-specific patterns (each station is independent)
  - Account for after-hours behavior (bikes outside without docking)

- ✅ **Feature selection validation**:
  - Ensure no dock-related features in final model
  - Validate that model doesn't assume dock-based operations

**Reference:** See M2_01 SOLUTIONS notebook, Task 8.1 for full explanation.

## 🎓 Course Development Strategy

### Pedagogical Approach for This Module
Module 5 introduces **machine learning modeling** with careful scaffolding for new ML practitioners.

**Scaffolding Strategy:**
- **Initial**: 65% complete - Learn model training workflows
- **Progressive**: 65% → 25% as confidence builds
- **Goal**: Train models independently, compare effectively, select best approach
- **Approach**: Baseline → Simple models → Complex models → Model selection

**Progressive Difficulty (Each Notebook):**
- Part 1: Model Setup (85% complete)
- Part 2: Basic Training (60%)
- Part 3: Hyperparameter Tuning (45%)
- Part 4: Model Comparison (30%)
- Part 5: Advanced Techniques (15% + optional)

**Solution Notebooks:**
- Separate `*_SOLUTIONS.ipynb` with multiple approaches
- Different hyperparameter strategies shown
- Model interpretation examples

**Optional Challenges:**
- Ensemble methods
- Custom model architectures
- Advanced cross-validation strategies

## ⚠️ Important
- Respect temporal ordering in time series data
- Never train on test data (data leakage!)
- Use same preprocessing for all datasets
- Document all modeling decisions

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
For regression tasks, consider:
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error) - easy to interpret
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) - penalizes large errors
- R² (R-squared) - proportion of variance explained
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) - relative error
