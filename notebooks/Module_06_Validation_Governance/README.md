# Module 06: Validation & Governance

## 📌 Module Overview
Validate model performance, ensure fairness, and establish governance practices for production deployment.

## 🎯 Track-Aware Validation

**Both tracks converge in Modules 6-10, but validation approaches differ by model type.**

### Validation Differences by Track

| Aspect | Track A (Classification) | Track B (Regression/Time Series) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Primary Metrics** | Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 | RMSE, MAE, residual plots |
| **Cross-Validation** | Stratified K-fold (class balance) | Time-series CV (rolling window) |
| **Error Analysis** | False positives/negatives analysis | Residual analysis, forecast errors |
| **Threshold Tuning** | ROC curve, precision-recall tradeoff | N/A (continuous predictions) |
| **Key Risks** | Class imbalance bias | Overfitting to trends, data leakage |
| **Business Validation** | "How often do we mislead commuters?" | "How accurate are our forecasts?" |

### Common Validation Tasks (Both Tracks)
- Test set evaluation (final performance)
- Feature importance validation
- Model assumptions checking
- Edge case analysis
- Documentation and model cards
- Governance framework

## ⚠️ Critical Domain Insight for Course Developers

**OV-fiets System Characteristics:**
- **No docking system**: `docks_available` field is always 0
- **Same-station returns**: Bikes must return to origin station
- **After-hours flexibility**: Bikes can be left outside without docking

**Impact on Module 6 Validation & Governance:**
- ✅ **Validation checks to include**:
  - Verify no dock-related features used in model
  - Confirm predictions respect: `0 ≤ bikes_available ≤ station_capacity`
  - Validate same-station return constraint assumptions
  - Check model doesn't predict cross-station transfers

- ✅ **Business rule validation**:
  - `bikes_available` must be integer values
  - Station capacity constraints must hold
  - After-hours patterns should be documented
  - System limitations (no docking) must be in model cards

- ✅ **Documentation requirements**:
  - Explicitly state: "Model designed for OV-fiets (no-dock system)"
  - Document why dock-based approaches don't apply
  - Note transferability limitations to dock-based systems (Citi Bike, Vélib, etc.)
  - Include system-specific assumptions in model governance docs

- ✅ **Error analysis considerations**:
  - Errors during after-hours periods (unique behavior)
  - Station-specific capacity mismatches
  - Misaligned with dock-based benchmark models (expected!)

**Reference:** See M2_01 SOLUTIONS notebook, Task 8.1 for full explanation.

## 🎓 Course Development Strategy

### Pedagogical Approach for This Module
Module 6 teaches **validation and governance** - critical for production ML.

**Scaffolding Strategy:**
- **Initial**: 70% complete - Learn validation frameworks
- **Progressive**: 70% → 30% emphasizing critical thinking
- **Goal**: Design validation strategies, document thoroughly, ensure reproducibility
- **Approach**: Standards → Apply → Design custom validation → Document

**Progressive Difficulty (Each Notebook):**
- Part 1: Validation Concepts (85% complete)
- Part 2: Implement Validation (60%)
- Part 3: Edge Cases (40%)
- Part 4: Documentation (30%)
- Part 5: Governance Framework (20% + organizational design)

**Solution Notebooks:**
- Separate `*_SOLUTIONS.ipynb` with industry standards
- Multiple documentation templates
- Validation strategy examples

**Optional Challenges:**
- Automated validation pipelines
- Custom monitoring dashboards
- Production deployment checklists
