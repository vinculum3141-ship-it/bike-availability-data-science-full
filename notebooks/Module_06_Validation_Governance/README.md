# Module 06: Validation & Governance

## 📌 Module Overview
Validate model performance, ensure fairness, and establish governance practices for production deployment.

## ⚠️ Critical Domain Insight for Course Developers

**OV-fiets System Characteristics:**
- **No docking system**: `docks_available` field is always 0
- **Same-station returns**: Bikes must return to origin station
- **After-hours flexibility**: Bikes can be left outside without docking

**Impact on Module 6 Validation & Governance:**
- ✅ **Validation checks to include**:
  - Verify no dock-related features used in model
  - Confirm predictions respect: `0 ≤ bikes_available ≤ station_capacity`
  - Validate same-station return constraint assumptions
  - Check model doesn't predict cross-station transfers

- ✅ **Business rule validation**:
  - `bikes_available` must be integer values
  - Station capacity constraints must hold
  - After-hours patterns should be documented
  - System limitations (no docking) must be in model cards

- ✅ **Documentation requirements**:
  - Explicitly state: "Model designed for OV-fiets (no-dock system)"
  - Document why dock-based approaches don't apply
  - Note transferability limitations to dock-based systems (Citi Bike, Vélib, etc.)
  - Include system-specific assumptions in model governance docs

- ✅ **Error analysis considerations**:
  - Errors during after-hours periods (unique behavior)
  - Station-specific capacity mismatches
  - Misaligned with dock-based benchmark models (expected!)

**Reference:** See M2_01 SOLUTIONS notebook, Task 8.1 for full explanation.

## 🎓 Course Development Strategy

### Pedagogical Approach for This Module
Module 6 teaches **validation and governance** - critical for production ML.

**Scaffolding Strategy:**
- **Initial**: 70% complete - Learn validation frameworks
- **Progressive**: 70% → 30% emphasizing critical thinking
- **Goal**: Design validation strategies, document thoroughly, ensure reproducibility
- **Approach**: Standards → Apply → Design custom validation → Document

**Progressive Difficulty (Each Notebook):**
- Part 1: Validation Concepts (85% complete)
- Part 2: Implement Validation (60%)
- Part 3: Edge Cases (40%)
- Part 4: Documentation (30%)
- Part 5: Governance Framework (20% + organizational design)

**Solution Notebooks:**
- Separate `*_SOLUTIONS.ipynb` with industry standards
- Multiple documentation templates
- Validation strategy examples

**Optional Challenges:**
- Automated validation pipelines
- Custom monitoring dashboards
- Production deployment checklists

## 📝 Naming Convention
Follow this pattern: `M6_{number}_{description}.ipynb`

## 💡 Tips
- Start with the [notebook template](../notebook_template.ipynb) for consistent structure
- Use `src/evaluation.py` for evaluation functions
- Check [model documentation guidelines](../../docs/standards/model_documentation_guidelines.md) for templates
- Reference [code snippets](../../docs/standards/code_snippets.md) for evaluation examples
- Be honest about model limitations
- Think about production monitoring
- Follow [coding standards](../../docs/standards/coding_standards.md) for clean code

## 📚 Key Libraries & Resources
**Libraries**:
- `scikit-learn` - Evaluation metrics
