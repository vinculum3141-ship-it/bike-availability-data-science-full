# Module 01: Introduction to the Project

## 📌 Module Overview
Introduction to the bike availability prediction project, setting up your environment, and understanding the problem domain.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Understand the bike-sharing business problem
- Set up your development environment (local or Google Colab)
- Navigate the project structure
- Create your first Jupyter notebook
- Understand the data science workflow

## ✅ Your Tasks
Create the following notebooks in this folder:

### M1_01_project_introduction.ipynb
- Project overview and business context
- Why predict bike availability?
- Key stakeholders and use cases
- Success metrics

### M1_02_environment_setup.ipynb
- Install required packages
- Test your Python environment
- Verify library versions
- Import common packages

### M1_03_problem_definition.ipynb
- Define the prediction problem
- Identify input features (weather, time, location, etc.)
- Define target variable (bike availability)
- Set project goals and constraints

## 📝 Naming Convention
Follow this pattern: `M1_{number}_{description}.ipynb`

Example:
- `M1_01_project_introduction.ipynb`
- `M1_02_environment_setup.ipynb`

## 💡 Tips
- Start with the [notebook template](../notebook_template.ipynb) for consistent structure
- Review the [example notebook](../example_data_exploration.ipynb) for best practices
- Use markdown cells to explain your thinking
- Include code comments for clarity
- Save your work frequently
- Follow the [coding standards](../../docs/coding_standards.md)

## 📚 Resources
- 📓 [Notebook Template](../notebook_template.ipynb) - Copy this to start
- 📐 [Coding Standards](../../docs/coding_standards.md) - Write clean code
- 📚 [Code Snippets](../../docs/code_snippets.md) - Quick reference
- 🔧 [Google Colab Setup](../../docs/setup_google_colab.md) - Cloud setup
- 🤝 [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) - Guidelines
- 🔧 [Dependency Management](../../docs/dependency_management.md) - Environment setup

## ✨ Checkpoint
Before moving to Module 02, ensure:
- [ ] Environment is set up and tested
- [ ] You understand the problem domain
- [ ] You can create and run Jupyter notebooks
- [ ] All notebooks follow the naming convention
