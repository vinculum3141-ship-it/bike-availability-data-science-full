# Module 01: Introduction to the Project

## 📌 Module Overview
Introduction to the bike availability prediction project, setting up your environment, and understanding the problem domain. This module focuses on **orientation, confidence, and setup** — not modeling yet!

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- ✔ Understand the bike-sharing business problem and smart cities context
- ✔ Understand the full project lifecycle (what you will build end-to-end)
- ✔ Set up your development environment (Google Colab or local)
- ✔ Know which open data sources will be used and why
- ✔ Successfully run notebooks and verify your setup
- ✔ Load and inspect a sample dataset with basic exploration
- ✔ Define the prediction problem clearly

## ✅ Your Tasks
Complete the following notebooks in this folder:

### M1_01_project_overview.ipynb
**Purpose**: Set context, motivate learners, explain what you'll build
- Welcome & course overview
- Smart cities and bike-sharing context
- Why this project matters
- End-to-end workflow preview (all 10 modules)
- Portfolio outcomes
- **No code** - pure orientation

### M1_02_environment_setup.ipynb
**Purpose**: Remove all technical barriers and build confidence
- Google Colab setup (step-by-step)
- Local environment setup (alternative)
- Install required packages
- Test Python environment
- Verify library versions and imports
- **Minimal code** - just setup verification

### M1_03_open_data_sources.ipynb
**Purpose**: Understand where data comes from and why open data matters
- What is open data?
- Primary data sources (bike + weather APIs)
- Light API demo: fetch and peek at data
- Brief mention of enrichment sources (holidays, geography, etc.)
- Link to full data catalog
- **Light code** - builds confidence with APIs

### M1_04_sample_data_exploration.ipynb
**Purpose**: Build confidence with hands-on data exploration
- Load sample dataset (pre-downloaded CSV)
- Basic EDA: `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.head()`
- Simple time series visualization
- Define the prediction problem (features & target)
- Set project goals and success metrics
- **Hands-on code** - practical data science skills

## 📝 Naming Convention
Follow this pattern: `M1_{number}_{description}.ipynb`

Examples:
- `M1_01_project_overview.ipynb`
- `M1_02_environment_setup.ipynb`
- `M1_03_open_data_sources.ipynb`
- `M1_04_sample_data_exploration.ipynb`

## 💡 Tips
- Start with the [notebook template](../notebook_template.ipynb) for consistent structure
- Review the [example notebook](../example_data_exploration.ipynb) for best practices
- Use markdown cells to explain your thinking process
- Include code comments for clarity
- Save your work frequently
- Follow the [coding standards](../../docs/coding_standards.md)
- Don't worry about perfection - focus on learning!
- Run each notebook cell-by-cell to understand the flow

## ✨ Definition of Done (Checkpoint)
Before moving to Module 02, ensure:
- [ ] ✅ You can open the repo in Google Colab (or run locally)
- [ ] ✅ All Module 01 notebooks run without errors
- [ ] ✅ You understand the bike-sharing problem and business context
- [ ] ✅ You know the primary data sources (bikes + weather)
- [ ] ✅ You can load sample data and perform basic EDA
- [ ] ✅ You can clearly define the prediction problem
- [ ] ✅ Your environment is set up and verified
- [ ] ✅ You understand the full learning journey (10 modules)

**Key Outcome**: Confidence and clarity — you know what you're building and why!
