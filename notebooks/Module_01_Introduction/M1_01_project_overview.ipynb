    "\n",
    "### What Are Smart Cities?\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart cities use **data, technology, and infrastructure** to improve quality of life for residents. Key goals include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🚦 **Efficient transportation** - Reduce congestion and emissions\n",
    "- 🌱 **Sustainability** - Lower carbon footprint\n",
    "- 👥 **Accessibility** - Mobility for all citizens\n",
    "- 📊 **Data-driven decisions** - Use real-world insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Rise of Bike-Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike-sharing systems are a cornerstone of smart city mobility:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First-Mile/Last-Mile Solution**: Connect people to public transit\n",
    "- **Sustainable Alternative**: Zero emissions, promotes health\n",
    "- **Flexible & Affordable**: Pay-per-use, accessible to many\n",
    "- **Data-Rich**: Every trip generates valuable data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Cities**: Amsterdam, Paris, London, New York, Washington DC, San Francisco, Copenhagen\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚴 How Bike-Sharing Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. User finds nearby station (mobile app)\n",
    "2. Unlocks bike (QR code, RFID, or keypad)\n",
    "3. Rides to destination\n",
    "4. Returns bike to any station\n",
    "5. System tracks: time, location, bike availability\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: Real-time data on bike availability, trips, and patterns!"

    "### Why Predict Bike Availability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike-sharing operators face constant challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ **Problems Without Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Empty Stations** 🚫\n",
    "   - Users arrive, find no bikes\n",
    "   - Frustration → lost customers\n",
    "   - Bad reviews and low adoption\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Full Stations** 🚫\n",
    "   - Users cannot return bikes\n",
    "   - Must ride to another station (wastes time)\n",
    "   - Negative experience\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inefficient Rebalancing** 🚛\n",
    "   - Moving bikes costs money (trucks, labor)\n",
    "   - Without data, teams guess where to move bikes\n",
    "   - Wasted resources\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ **Benefits With Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Better User Experience** 😊\n",
    "   - Know bike availability before arriving\n",
    "   - Plan routes with confidence\n",
    "   - Reduced frustration\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimized Operations** 🎯\n",
    "   - Proactive rebalancing (move bikes before problems)\n",
    "   - Lower operational costs\n",
    "   - Data-driven fleet management\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strategic Planning** 📈\n",
    "   - Identify where to add new stations\n",
