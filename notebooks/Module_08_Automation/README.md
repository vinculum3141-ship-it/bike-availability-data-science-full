# Module 08: Automation & Pipelines

## 📌 Module Overview
Automate your data science workflow by creating reproducible pipelines.

---

## 🎯 Track-Aware Pipelines

**Pipeline design differs between classification and forecasting systems.**

### Pipeline Differences by Track

| Aspect | Track A (Classification) | Track B (Time Series) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Prediction Frequency** | Real-time (every 15 min) | Batch (daily forecasts) |
| **Data Requirements** | Current features only | Historical windows (7+ days) |
| **Feature Engineering** | Rush hour, weather, trains | Lag features, rolling stats, seasonality |
| **Model Inputs** | Single timestamp features | Time series sequences |
| **Output Format** | Binary predictions + probability | Numeric forecasts + intervals |
| **Retraining Trigger** | Performance degradation | Seasonal changes, drift |
| **Monitoring Focus** | False negative rate | Forecast RMSE by horizon |

### Common Pipeline Components (Both Tracks)
- Data acquisition automation
- Feature engineering scripts
- Model training workflows
- Prediction generation
- Performance monitoring
- Scheduled retraining

## 🎓 Course Development Strategy

### Pedagogical Approach for This Module
Module 8 teaches **automation and MLOps** - transitioning notebooks to production.

**Scaffolding Strategy:**
- **Initial**: 60% complete - Learn automation patterns
- **Progressive**: 60% → 20% emphasizing system design
- **Goal**: Convert notebooks to scripts, build pipelines, automate workflows
- **Approach**: Script conversion → Pipeline design → Scheduling → Monitoring

**Progressive Difficulty (Each Notebook):**
- Part 1: Automation Concepts (75% complete)
- Part 2: Script Conversion (50%)
- Part 3: Pipeline Building (35%)
- Part 4: Scheduling (25%)
- Part 5: Production Systems (15% + architecture design)

**Solution Notebooks:**
- Separate `*_SOLUTIONS.ipynb` with production patterns
- Multiple pipeline architectures
- Error handling strategies

**Optional Challenges:**
- Airflow/Prefect DAGs
- Containerization with Docker
- Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)
