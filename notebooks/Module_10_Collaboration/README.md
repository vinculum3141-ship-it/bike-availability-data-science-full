# Module 10: Collaboration & Best Practices

## 📌 Module Overview
Learn collaboration workflows, code review, documentation, and professional data science practices.

---

## 🎯 Track-Aware Collaboration

**Communication needs differ when presenting classification vs forecasting models.**

### Stakeholder Communication Differences

| Aspect | Track A (Classification) | Track B (Time Series) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Business Question** | "Will bikes be available?" | "How many bikes over 3 days?" |
| **Audience** | Commuters, operations team | Tourists, capacity planners |
| **Key Metric** | False negative rate | Forecast accuracy (MAPE) |
| **Visualization** | Alert dashboard, traffic lights | Forecast calendars, trend charts |
| **Uncertainty** | Prediction confidence (%) | Confidence intervals (±N bikes) |
| **Decision Support** | "Go to this station now" | "Plan your trip for Tuesday AM" |
| **Success Story** | "Reduced empty station visits by 40%" | "Forecast accuracy within ±2 bikes" |

### Common Collaboration Tasks (Both Tracks)
- Git workflows and branching
- Code review practices
- Documentation standards
- Deployment strategies
- Production monitoring

## 🎓 Course Development Strategy

### Pedagogical Approach for This Module
Module 10 teaches **collaboration and deployment** - working in teams and production.

**Scaffolding Strategy:**
- **Initial**: 60% complete - Learn Git workflows and deployment
- **Progressive**: 60% → 15% for independent project work
- **Goal**: Collaborate effectively, deploy models, maintain production systems
- **Approach**: Git basics → Team workflows → Code review → Deployment

**Progressive Difficulty (Each Notebook):**
- Part 1: Git Fundamentals (75% complete)
- Part 2: Branching Strategy (50%)
- Part 3: Code Review (35%)
- Part 4: Deployment (25%)
- Part 5: Production Maintenance (15% + capstone integration)

**Solution Notebooks:**
- Separate `*_SOLUTIONS.ipynb` with workflow examples
- Multiple deployment strategies
- Production best practices

**Optional Challenges:**
- CI/CD pipelines
- Kubernetes deployments
- Model monitoring systems

**Capstone Integration:**
- Apply all 10 modules to final project
- Portfolio-ready deliverables
- End-to-end system demonstration

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Use Git effectively for collaboration
- Write clear documentation
- Conduct code reviews
- Follow data science best practices
- Prepare for production deployment

## ✅ Your Tasks

**Complete these notebooks - examples provided for both tracks:**

### M10_01_git_workflow.ipynb
**Both tracks (same practices):**
- Git branching strategies (feature/bugfix branches)
- Meaningful commit messages with context
- Merge conflict resolution
- Pull request reviews
- Code collaboration workflows

### M10_02_code_quality.ipynb
**Track A: Classification code standards**
- Threshold configuration management
- Classification pipeline modularity
- Unit tests for prediction logic
- Alert generation testing

**Track B: Forecasting code standards**
- Time series validation (no data leakage)
- Forecast pipeline modularity
- Unit tests for windowing logic
- Uncertainty calculation testing

**Both tracks:**
- PEP 8 compliance
- Type hints and docstrings
- Error handling patterns
- Code review checklist

### M10_03_documentation.ipynb
- Write clean, readable code
- Add docstrings and type hints
- Use linting tools (pylint, black)
- Refactor code for maintainability

### M10_03_documentation.ipynb
- Write comprehensive README files
- Create API documentation
- Document data sources and assumptions
- Build knowledge base

### M10_04_deployment_prep.ipynb
- Prepare model for deployment
- Create deployment checklist
- Document dependencies
- Plan monitoring strategy

## 📝 Naming Convention
Follow this pattern: `M10_{number}_{description}.ipynb`

## 💡 Tips
