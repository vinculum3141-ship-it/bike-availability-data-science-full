# Module 03: Exploration & Profiling

## 📌 Module Overview
Explore your datasets, understand distributions, identify patterns, and detect data quality issues. **This module ends with a critical decision point** — you'll choose your learning track based on patterns you discover.

**🎯 Dual-Track Context**: This is the **last foundation module** (shared by all students). By the end, you'll identify **two distinct rental patterns** and choose between:
- **Track A (Beginner):** Classification for commuter short-term predictions
- **Track B (Advanced):** Regression + Time series for multi-day forecasting

**Decision Point**: End of this module → See "Track Selection Decision" section below

## ⚠️ Critical Domain Insight for Course Developers

**OV-fiets System Characteristics:**
- **No docking system**: `docks_available` field is always 0
- **Same-station returns**: Bikes must return to origin station
- **After-hours flexibility**: Bikes can be left outside without docking

**Impact on Module 3:**
- ❌ Don't expect dock utilization patterns in data
- ✅ Focus exploration on bike availability patterns only
- ✅ Station "capacity" = bike inventory, not physical docks
- ✅ Identify temporal patterns in bike availability
- ✅ Document this finding in profiling reports

**Reference:** See M2_01 SOLUTIONS notebook, Task 8.1 for full explanation.

## 🎓 Course Development Strategy

### Pedagogical Approach for This Module
Module 3 introduces **new data exploration concepts** using progressive scaffolding.

**Scaffolding Strategy:**
- **Initial**: 70% complete - Learn EDA patterns and profiling tools
- **Progressive**: 70% → 30% through 5 parts per notebook
- **Goal**: Master exploration techniques, identify patterns independently

- Part 2: Guided Practice (70%)
- Part 3: Moderate Analysis (50%)
- Part 4: Independent Exploration (30%)
- Part 5: Advanced Insights (10% + optional)

**Solution Notebooks:**
- Separate `*_SOLUTIONS.ipynb` for each notebook

## 🎯 TRACK SELECTION DECISION POINT

**Congratulations!** You've completed the foundation modules (1-3). Now it's time to **choose your learning path**.

### What You've Discovered
Through your exploration, you've identified **two distinct rental patterns**:

1. **Commuter Pattern (Short-term)**
   - Weekday peaks at 8-9 AM, 5-6 PM
   - Rental duration: 1-4 hours
   - Predictable daily patterns
   - Train schedule correlation

2. **Tourist Pattern (Multi-day)**
   - Weekend and holiday spikes
   - Rental duration: 12-72 hours
   - Seasonal variation
   - Event-driven demand

### Your Track Options
